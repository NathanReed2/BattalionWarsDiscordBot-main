## Key Research Findings

### System Architecture Analysis

**Modular Design Pattern**
```
Entry Point (index.js) → Event Handlers (7 modules) → Support Systems (1 module)
├── Configuration Layer (Static + Environment)
├── Runtime State Management (Caches + Buffers)
└── Asset Management (Images + File System)
```

**Connection Point Matrix**
- **11 Direct Module Dependencies** creating a web of interconnected functionality
- **6 Event Flow Paths** from Discord API to application logic
- **Multiple Data Flow Streams** between configuration, runtime state, and external resources

### Logic Flow Patterns

**Primary Workflows Identified**:
1. **User Verification Workflow** (3 trigger points, 15 processing steps)
2. **Mission Selection Workflow** (1 trigger point, 10 processing steps)
3. **Role Synchronization Workflow** (1 trigger point, 5 processing steps)

**Event-Driven Processing**:
- Reactive architecture responding to Discord API events
- Asynchronous processing with Promise-based error handling
- State management through in-memory caches and buffers

### Data Structure Analysis

**Configuration Objects**:
- **Static Configuration**: 22 hardcoded IDs for guilds, channels, and roles
- **Dynamic Configuration**: 1 environment variable for authentication
- **Mission Data**: 16 missions across 3 categories with weighted selection

**Runtime State Objects**:
- **Auto-Verify Setting**: Boolean flag controlling verification behavior
- **Invite Cache**: Map-based tracking of guild invites for verification
- **Mission Buffers**: 4 sliding-window arrays for weighted selection algorithm

### Algorithm Analysis

**Weighted Mission Selection**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = missions per category
- **Algorithm**: Inverse pick-rate weighting with normalization
- **Buffer Management**: Sliding window with even distribution initialization

**Invite Tracking**:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m) where m = active invites
- **Purpose**: Determine if new members joined via invite links
- **Cache Management**: Runtime-only storage with event-based refresh

### Security Framework

**Permission Hierarchy**:
- **4 Permission Levels** (Administrator, Moderator, Verified User, Unverified User)
- **Role-Based Access Control** with Discord permission integration
- **Input Validation Chain** with 5 validation steps

**Security Controls**:
- Environment variable isolation for authentication
- Permission bit field validation for administrative commands
- Guild restriction through hardcoded validation
- No persistent storage of user data (Discord IDs only)

## Flow Analysis Summary

### Event Flow Patterns

**Primary Event Flows**:
1. **Discord Client Events** → **Event Handlers** → **Business Logic** → **Discord API Calls**
2. **User Actions** → **Permission Validation** → **State Changes** → **Response Generation**
3. **Configuration Loading** → **Runtime Initialization** → **Continuous Processing**

**Cross-Module Dependencies**:
- Message handlers share common processing logic
- Role management spans multiple event handlers
- Configuration constants used across all modules
- Error handling integrated throughout the system

### Data Flow Patterns

**Configuration Flow**:
```
.env File → Environment Variables → Discord Client → Event Handler Registration
Static Constants → Module Imports → Runtime Validation → API Operations
```

**Mission Selection Flow**:
```
User Command → Category Selection → Buffer Analysis → Weight Calculation → 
Random Selection → Buffer Update → Image Loading → Response Generation
```

**Verification Flow**:
```
New Member → Age Check → Invite Analysis → Role Assignment → 
Language Role Conversion → Logging → Notification
```
